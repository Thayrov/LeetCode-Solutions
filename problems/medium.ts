/* 
2. Add Two Numbers


You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Topics
Companies
Hint

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

Example 1:

​Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109 

</>Code:
*/

  // Extract x-coordinates from the array of points and sort them in ascending order.
  // map(point => point[0]): Extracts the x-coordinate (first element of each sub-array).
  // sort((a, b) => a - b): Sorts the x-coordinates in ascending numerical order.
  let xCoords = points.map(point => point[0]).sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Initialize the variable to store the maximum width of the vertical area.
  let maxGap = 0;

  // Iterate through the sorted x-coordinates starting from the second element.
  for (let i = 1; i < xCoords.length; i++) {
    // Calculate the gap between the current and previous x-coordinate.

    // and updates maxGap with the larger value.
    maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, xCoords[i] - xCoords[i - 1]);
  }

  // Return the largest gap found, which is the widest vertical area.

/* 
91. Decode Ways

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.



Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

*/

function numDecodings(s: string): number {
  // If the string is empty or starts with '0', there are no valid decodings.
  if (s.length === 0 || s[0] === '0') {
    return 0;
  }

  // dp array to store the number of ways to decode up to the ith character
  let dp = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(0);
  dp[0] = 1; // Base case: one way to decode an empty string
  dp[1] = s[0] !== '0' ? 1 : 0; // There is one way if the first character is not '0', otherwise 0 ways

  // Iterate over the string starting from the second character
  for (let i = 2; i <= s.length; i++) {
    // Check if the single digit is valid (not '0')
    if (s[i - 1] !== '0') {
      // If valid, the number of ways to decode it is the same as the previous character
      dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
    }

    // Check if the two digits form a valid number between 10 and 26

1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum
Medium

You have n dice, and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.
There is only one way to get a sum of 3.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.
There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.

Example 3:

Input: n = 30, k = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: The answer must be returned modulo 109 + 7.

1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

Example 1:

Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.

Example 2:

Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.

Example 3:

Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.


Constraints:

n == colors.length == neededTime.length

2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions

You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length
