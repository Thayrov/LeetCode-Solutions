/* 
2. Add Two Numbers


You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Topics
Companies
Hint
Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

Example 1:

​
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109

function maxWidthOfVerticalArea(points: number[][]): number {
  // Extract x-coordinates from the array of points and sort them in ascending order.
  // map(point => point[0]): Extracts the x-coordinate (first element of each sub-array).
  // sort((a, b) => a - b): Sorts the x-coordinates in ascending numerical order.
  let xCoords = points.map(point => point[0]).sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Initialize the variable to store the maximum width of the vertical area.
  let maxGap = 0;

  // Iterate through the sorted x-coordinates starting from the second element.
  for (let i = 1; i < xCoords.length; i++) {
    // Calculate the gap between the current and previous x-coordinate.
    // Math.max(maxGap, xCoords[i] - xCoords[i - 1]): Compares the current gap with the maximum gap found so far,
    // and updates maxGap with the larger value.
    maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, xCoords[i] - xCoords[i - 1]);
  }

  // Return the largest gap found, which is the widest vertical area.
  return maxGap;
