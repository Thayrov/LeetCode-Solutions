/* 
2. Add Two Numbers


You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Hint

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

Example 1:

​Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109

/* 
91. Decode Ways

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.



Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3

1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

Example 1:

Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.

2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions

You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.

2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.

There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.
Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.


Example 1:

Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
Output: 8
Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.


Example 2:

Input: bank = ["000","111","000"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:

- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].

1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.


Example 1:

Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.


Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.


Example 3:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s.length == t.length
s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.

</> Typescript Code:

/* 
1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close
Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -> aecdb
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.


Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"


Example 2:

Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.


Example 3:

Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"


Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105
word1 and word2 contain only lowercase English letters.

</> Typescript Code:

2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses

You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.


Example 1:

Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].


Example 2:

Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].


Constraints:

1 <= matches.length <= 105
matches[i].length == 2
1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105
winneri != loseri
All matches[i] are unique.

380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

Implement the RandomizedSet class:

RandomizedSet() Initializes the RandomizedSet object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.
You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in average O(1) time complexity.


Example 1:

Input
["RandomizedSet", "insert", "remove", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "insert", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]

Explanation
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.

931. Minimum Falling Path Sum

Given an n x n array of integers matrix, return the minimum sum of any falling path through matrix.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position (row, col) will be (row + 1, col - 1), (row + 1, col), or (row + 1, col + 1).
