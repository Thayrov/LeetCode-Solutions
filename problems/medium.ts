/* 
2. Add Two Numbers


You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

Hint

Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

Example 1:

â€‹Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

Constraints:

n == points.length
2 <= n <= 105
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 109

/* 
91. Decode Ways

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.



Example 1:

Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:

Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:

Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3

1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

Example 1:

Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.

2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions

You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.
Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Note that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.

2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array bank representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. bank[i] represents the ith row, consisting of '0's and '1's. '0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.

There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.
Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.


Example 1:

Input: bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
Output: 8
Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]

 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.


Example 2:

Input: bank = ["000","111","000"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].

1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.


Example 1:

Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.


Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.


Example 3:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.

1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close
Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -> aecdb
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.


Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"


Example 2:

Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.


Example 3:

Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"

2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses

You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.


Example 1:

Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].


Example 2:

Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].

380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

Implement the RandomizedSet class:

RandomizedSet() Initializes the RandomizedSet object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.

For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

Example 1:

Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.  

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1]

2971. Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter

You are given an array of positive integers nums of length n.

A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.

Conversely, if you have k (k >= 3) positive real numbers a1, a2, a3, ..., ak where a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= ... <= ak and a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + ak-1 > ak, then there always exists a polygon with k sides whose lengths are a1, a2, a3, ..., ak.

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of lengths of its sides.

Return the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed from nums, or -1 if it is not possible to create a polygon.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,5,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

Example 1:
Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
Output: 7

Example 3:
Input: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0

787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.

You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
Output: 700
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation:
The graph is shown above.
The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

1609. Even Odd Tree

A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:

The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).
Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]
Output: true
Explanation: The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [1]
Level 1: [10,4]
Level 2: [3,7,9]
Level 3: [12,8,6,2]
Since levels 0 and 2 are all odd and increasing and levels 1 and 3 are all even and decreasing, the tree is Even-Odd.

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,4,2,3,3,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node values on each level are:
Level 0: [5]
Level 1: [4,2]
Level 2: [3,3,7]
Node values in level 2 must be in strictly increasing order, so the tree is not Even-Odd.

Example 3:
Input: root = [5,9,1,3,5,7]
Output: false
Explanation: Node values in the level 1 should be even integers.

948. Bag of Tokens

You start with an initial power of power, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens given as an integer array tokens, where each tokens[i] donates the value of tokeni.

Your goal is to maximize the total score by strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):

Face-up: If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play tokeni, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.
Face-down: If your current score is at least 1, you may play tokeni, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.
Return the maximum possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

Example 1:
Input: tokens = [100], power = 50
Output: 0
Explanation: Since your score is 0 initially, you cannot play the token face-down. You also cannot play it face-up since your power (50) is less than tokens[0] (100).

Example 2:
Input: tokens = [200,100], power = 150
Output: 1
Explanation: Play token1 (100) face-up, reducing your power to 50 and increasing your score to 1.
There is no need to play token0, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is 1.

Example 3:
Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200
Output: 2
Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:
Play token0 (100) face-up, reducing power to 100 and increasing score to 1.
Play token3 (400) face-down, increasing power to 500 and reducing score to 0.
Play token1 (200) face-up, reducing power to 300 and increasing score to 1.
Play token2 (300) face-up, reducing power to 0 and increasing score to 2.

1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends

Given a string s consisting only of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:

Pick a non-empty prefix from the string s where all the characters in the prefix are equal.
Pick a non-empty suffix from the string s where all the characters in this suffix are equal.
The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
Delete both the prefix and the suffix.
Return the minimum length of s after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times).

Example 1:
Input: s = "ca"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can't remove any characters, so the string stays as is.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cabaabac"
Output: 0
Explanation: An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "c" and suffix = "c" and remove them, s = "abaaba".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "baab".
- Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "b" and remove them, s = "aa".
- Take prefix = "a" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "".

Example 3:
Input: s = "aabccabba"
Output: 3
Explanation: An optimal sequence of operations is:
- Take prefix = "aa" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "bccabb".

791. Custom Sort String

You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

Example 1:
Input:  order = "cba", s = "abcd" 
Output:  "cbad" 
Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

Example 2:
Input:  order = "bcafg", s = "abcd" 
Output:  "bcad" 
Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.
Following the order of appearance in order, "b", "c", and "a" from s should be arranged as "b", "c", "a". "d" can be placed at any position since it's not in order. The output "bcad" correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like "bacd" or "bcda" would also be valid, as long as "b", "c", "a" maintain their order.

452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Example 1:
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

Example 2:
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

Example 3:
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].

621. Task Scheduler

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:
Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order

You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

1. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
2. If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
3. If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.

Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

Example 1:
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.

Example 2:
Input: deck = [1,1000]

1 <= deck.length <= 1000
1 <= deck[i] <= 10^6

Example 1:
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

Example 2:
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

Example 3:

129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.

623. Add One Row to Tree

Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.

Note that the root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is:

Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur's left subtree root and right subtree root.
cur's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
cur's original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
If depth == 1 that means there is no depth depth - 1 at all, then create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,6,3,1,5], val = 1, depth = 2

1992. Find All Groups of Farmland

You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

land can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of land is (0, 0) and the bottom right corner of land is (m-1, n-1). Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each group of farmland. A group of farmland with a top left corner at (r1, c1) and a bottom right corner at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2].

Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each group of farmland in land. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: land = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
Explanation:
The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[0][0].

752. Open the Lock

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

Example 1:
Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".

Example 2:
Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".

Example 3:
Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot reach the target without getting stuck.

Constraints:
1 <= deadends.length <= 500

310. Minimum Height Trees

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.

The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

Example 2:
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
edges.length == n - 1
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
All the pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.
The given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated edges.

2370. Longest Ideal Subsequence

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters and an integer k. We call a string t ideal if the following conditions are satisfied:

t is a subsequence of the string s.
The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in t is less than or equal to k.
Return the length of the longest ideal string.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Note that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet order of 'a' and 'z' is 25, not 1.

Example 1:
Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.
Note that "acfgbd" is not ideal because 'c' and 'f' have a difference of 3 in alphabet order.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "abcd". The length of this string is 4, so 4 is returned.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5

/* 
2997. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a positive integer k.

You can apply the following operation on the array any number of times:

Choose any element of the array and flip a bit in its binary representation. Flipping a bit means changing a 0 to 1 or vice versa.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the bitwise XOR of all elements of the final array equal to k.

Note that you can flip leading zero bits in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number (101)2 you can flip the fourth bit and obtain (1101)2.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose element 2 which is 3 == (011)2, we flip the first bit and we obtain (010)2 == 2. nums becomes [2,1,2,4].
- Choose element 0 which is 2 == (010)2, we flip the third bit and we obtain (110)2 = 6. nums becomes [6,1,2,4].
The XOR of elements of the final array is (6 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 4) == 1 == k.
It can be shown that we cannot make the XOR equal to k in less than 2 operations.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,0], k = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: The XOR of elements of the array is (2 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 0) == 0 == k. So no operation is needed.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
0 <= k <= 10^6

</> Typescript Code:

  // Reduce the array to a single XOR value starting with an initial value of 0,
  // then XOR each element of the array (`c`) with the accumulator (`acc`).

    nums.reduce((acc, c) => acc ^ c, 0) ^ // Calculate the XOR of all elements in nums.
    k
  ) // XOR the result with k to find the difference needed.

1915. Number of Wonderful Substrings

A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.

For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.
Given a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters ('a' through 'j'), return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word. If the same substring appears multiple times in word, then count each occurrence separately.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Example 1:
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The four wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "aba" -> "a"
- "aba" -> "b"
- "aba" -> "a"
- "aba" -> "aba"

Example 2:
Input: word = "aabb"
Output: 9
Explanation: The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "aabb" -> "a"
- "aabb" -> "aa"
- "aabb" -> "aab"
- "aabb" -> "aabb"
- "aabb" -> "a"
- "aabb" -> "abb"
- "aabb" -> "b"
- "aabb" -> "bb"
- "aabb" -> "b"

Example 3:
Input: word = "he"
Output: 2
Explanation: The two wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "he" -> "h"
- "he" -> "e"

165. Compare Version Numbers

Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.

Return the following:
If version1 < version2, return -1.
If version1 > version2, return 1.
Otherwise, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".

Example 2:
Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as "0".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is "0", while version2's revision 0 is "1". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

Constraints:
1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
version1 and version2 only contain digits and '.'.
version1 and version2 are valid version numbers.
All the given revisions in version1 and version2 can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

- Pick the child with the happiness value == 3. The happiness value of the remaining children becomes [0,1].
- Pick the child with the happiness value == 1. The happiness value of the remaining child becomes [0]. Note that the happiness value cannot become less than 0.
The sum of the happiness values of the selected children is 3 + 1 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: happiness = [1,1,1,1], k = 2

2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid

You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size n x n, where (r, c) represents:

A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0
You are initially positioned at cell (0, 0). In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.

The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.

Return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).

An adjacent cell of cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) and (r - 1, c) if it exists.

The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0). The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2). The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2). The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

Example 1:
Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  

Example 2:
Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: "10" corressponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  

Example 3:
Input: s = "1"
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of characters '0' or '1'
s[0] == '1'

  // Iterate from the end of the string towards the beginning
  for (let i = s.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    // Check if the current bit plus the carry is equal to 1 (odd)
    if (parseInt(s[i]) + carry === 1) {
      // If odd, we need to add 1 (which makes it even) and then divide by 2
      carry = 1; // Set carry to 1 for the next iteration
      steps += 2; // Two operations: add 1 and divide by 2
    } else {
      // If even, we just need to divide by 2

2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence

You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").

Example 3:
Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

648. Replace Words

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

523. Continuous Subarray Sum

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if nums has a good subarray or false otherwise.

A good subarray is a subarray where:

its length is at least two, and
the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of k.

Note that:
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [23,2,4,6,7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [23,2,6,4,7], k = 6

Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42.
42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.
