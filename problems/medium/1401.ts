/*
1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping

You are given a circle represented as (radius, xCenter, yCenter) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return true if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return false. In other words, check if there is any point (xi, yi) that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

Example 1:
Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = 1, y1 = -1, x2 = 3, y2 = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Circle and rectangle share the point (1,0).

Example 2:
Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 1, yCenter = 1, x1 = 1, y1 = -3, x2 = 2, y2 = -1
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = -1, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 1
Output: true

Constraints:
1 <= radius <= 2000
-10^4 <= xCenter, yCenter <= 10^4
-10^4 <= x1 < x2 <= 10^4
-10^4 <= y1 < y2 <= 10^4

function checkOverlap(radius: number, xCenter: number, yCenter: number, x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number): boolean {
  // Clamp circle center x to rectangle horizontal bounds.
  const closestX = xCenter < x1 ? x1 : xCenter > x2 ? x2 : xCenter;
  // Clamp circle center y to rectangle vertical bounds.
  const closestY = yCenter < y1 ? y1 : yCenter > y2 ? y2 : yCenter;
  // Compute horizontal distance from center to closest point.
  const dx = xCenter - closestX;
  // Compute vertical distance from center to closest point.
  const dy = yCenter - closestY;
  // Compare squared distance against squared radius to avoid sqrt.
  return dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius;
}
