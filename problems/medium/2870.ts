/*
2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].
It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to empty the array.


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106

function minOperations(nums: number[]): number {
  const freq = new Map<number, number>(); // Create a map to store frequencies of each number

  // Count frequencies of each number in nums
  for (const num of nums) {
    freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
  }

  let operations = 0; // Initialize the count of operations

  // Iterate through the frequency map
  for (const count of freq.values()) {
    // If count is odd and less than 3, it's impossible to empty the array
    if (count % 2 === 1 && count < 3) {
      return -1;
    }
    // Add the required operations for this number to the total operations
    operations += Math.ceil(count / 3);
  }

  // Return the total number of operations
  return operations;
}
